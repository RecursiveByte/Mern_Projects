    projectDesc: "The Solar System Project Simulation was a personal project I created to test and enhance my skills in React and Tailwind CSS. It featured a clean and interactive 2D representation of the solar system, with the Sun at the center and planets orbiting around it. The project allowed me to practice building dynamic, responsive user interfaces and styling them efficiently using Tailwind. By combining React's component-based structure with Tailwind's utility-first approach, I was able to create a visually appealing and functional simulation. This project not only deepened my understanding of these technologies but also resulted in a fun and educational tool to explore the solar system."

    projectDesc: "My Password Manager is a straightforward and functional application designed to help users store and manage their passwords. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), this project allows users to enter and view their saved passwords. The application retrieves data directly from a MongoDB database and displays the information that each user has entered.While the project is currently a basic implementation, it serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements. It demonstrates my ability to work with full-stack technologies, handle data storage and retrieval, and create a user-friendly interface. This project is a great starting point for adding advanced features like user authentication, data encryption, and personalized data isolation in the future."
